## Problem
[LeetCode 704: Binary Search (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/)

## Key Insight
When you encounter an **ordered array** in a coding interview, consider using binary search as a solution approach.

## Solution


```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            middle = left + (right - left) // 2
            if target > nums[middle]:
                left = middle + 1
            elif target < nums[middle]:
                right = middle - 1
            else:
                return middle
        
        return -1
```


## Important Notes
- This solution uses a **closed interval** `[left, right]` (both bounds inclusive)
- Other approaches may use half-open intervals like `[left, right)`
- Calculate `middle` as `left + (right - left) // 2` to avoid integer overflow
